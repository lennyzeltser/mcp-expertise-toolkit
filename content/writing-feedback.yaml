# Quality checks - specific things to look for with examples
qualityChecks:
  jargon:
    whatToCheck: "Technical terms or acronyms that may confuse the intended audience"
    whyItMatters: "Jargon excludes readers who don't know the terms, even if they're otherwise qualified to understand the content."
    examples:
      - bad: "Leverage the API's idempotent endpoints to ensure data consistency."
        good: "Use the API's endpoints that safely handle retries without duplicating data."
        explanation: "Explain technical concepts in plain language."
      - bad: "The ROI on this initiative will impact our P&L positively."
        good: "This project will make more money than it costs."
        explanation: "Business jargon can be just as excluding as technical jargon."

  passiveVoice:
    whatToCheck: "Sentences where the actor is unclear or responsibility is obscured"
    whyItMatters: "Passive voice hides who did what, making content harder to follow and less accountable."
    examples:
      - bad: "The report was submitted late."
        good: "The finance team submitted the report late."
        explanation: "Active voice clarifies who is responsible."
      - bad: "Mistakes were made in the process."
        good: "We made mistakes in the process."
        explanation: "Taking ownership builds trust."

  vagueTerms:
    whatToCheck: "Imprecise words that should be replaced with specifics"
    whyItMatters: "Vague terms force readers to guess what you mean, leading to misunderstandings."
    examples:
      - bad: "The system is very fast."
        good: "The system responds in under 100 milliseconds."
        explanation: "Specific numbers are more credible and useful."
      - bad: "We'll complete this soon."
        good: "We'll complete this by Friday."
        explanation: "Dates are clearer than relative timeframes."

  sentenceLength:
    whatToCheck: "Sentences over 25 words that could be split or simplified"
    whyItMatters: "Long sentences are harder to parse and often bury the main point."
    examples:
      - bad: "In order to ensure that we are able to meet the deadline that has been established for the project, it will be necessary for all team members to submit their work by the end of the day on Thursday."
        good: "To meet our project deadline, submit your work by Thursday end of day."
        explanation: "Cut unnecessary words and get to the point."

# Guidance for reviewing/critiquing content
reviewGuidance:
