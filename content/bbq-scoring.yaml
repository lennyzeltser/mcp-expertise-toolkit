principles:
  - name: "Appearance Sets Expectations"
    description: "Judges eat with their eyes first. Appearance score influences taste perception."
    guidelines:
      - "Color should be appetizing - mahogany for ribs, deep bark for brisket"
      - "Sauce should complement, not mask - no pooling in the box"
      - "Garnish (if used) must be approved parsley/cilantro/lettuce only"
      - "Uniform pieces show attention to detail"
      - "No sauce drips on the box liner"
    examples:
      - bad: "Heavy red sauce pooled in corner, hiding the meat color"
        good: "Thin glaze of sauce showing caramelization, meat color visible through"
        explanation: "Sauce enhances appearance; it shouldn't look like meat in a puddle"
      - bad: "Ribs cut into varying sizes, some bones exposed"
        good: "Six uniform rib pieces, clean bone presentation, consistent char"
        explanation: "Uniformity signals that the cook has control over their process"

  - name: "Taste Is Balance"
    description: "Great competition BBQ balances smoke, seasoning, sauce, and meat flavor."
    guidelines:
      - "Smoke should enhance, not overpower - no bitter creosote taste"
      - "Seasoning should complement the meat's natural flavor"
      - "If using sauce, it should have depth - sweet, savory, tangy, maybe heat"
      - "Salt level should be noticeable but not dominant"
      - "Each bite should taste intentional, not accidental"
    examples:
      - bad: "Aggressive smoke flavor that tastes like licking an ashtray"
        good: "Clean smoke with subtle sweetness, enhances the pork flavor"
        explanation: "Over-smoking is a common mistake; the meat should taste like meat"
      - bad: "One-note sweetness from commercial sauce"
        good: "Layers of flavor: initial sweetness, savory middle, slight tang finish"
        explanation: "Competition-level sauce has complexity and progression"

  - name: "Tenderness Is Texture"
    description: "Each meat has an ideal texture. Too tough or too soft both cost points."
    guidelines:
      - "Chicken should be tender but not mushy, skin should have some texture"
      - "Ribs should pull clean from the bone with light tug, not fall off"
      - "Pork should pull apart easily but have texture, not be paste"
      - "Brisket should slice cleanly and pull apart with gentle tug"
    examples:
      - bad: "Ribs where meat falls off bone when picked up"
        good: "Ribs where bite leaves clean teeth marks, meat releases from bone"
        explanation: "Fall-off-the-bone is overcooked for competition; it should tug"
      - bad: "Brisket that crumbles when sliced"
        good: "Brisket that holds together when lifted, bends without breaking"
        explanation: "The 'bend test' - properly cooked brisket flexes"

  - name: "Turn-In Presentation"
    description: "The turn-in box is your only communication with judges."
    guidelines:
      - "Box should look intentional, not hastily assembled"
      - "Meat placed with best side up, consistent orientation"
      - "Garnish creates contrast without overwhelming"
      - "Nothing in the box that shouldn't be (no toothpicks, no unapproved items)"
      - "Box should photograph well - judges often do"

checkpoints:
  - id: "appearance_color"
    name: "Color and Bark"
    purpose: "Proper color indicates correct cooking technique and temperature."
    whatIndicatesPresence:
      - "Mahogany to dark brown color on ribs and chicken"
      - "Deep, almost black bark on brisket with visible seasoning"

    commonProblems:
      - "Pale, undercooked appearance"
      - "Burnt black spots indicating hot spots or flare-ups"
      - "Raw-looking fat cap on brisket"
      - "Chicken skin that looks rubbery or unrendered"

      - "Fat not properly rendered"

qualityChecks:
  overcooked:
    whatToCheck: "Signs of cooking too long or at too high temperature"
    whyItMatters: "Overcooked BBQ loses moisture, texture, and often scores worse than undercooked"
    examples:
      - bad: "Ribs where meat slides off bone when touched"
        good: "Ribs where bite pulls meat cleanly, leaving teeth marks"
        explanation: "Competition tenderness is between tough and falling apart"
      - bad: "Brisket that crumbles when sliced"
        good: "Brisket that bends and flexes when held by the end"

  underseasoned:
    whatToCheck: "Flat or bland flavor from insufficient seasoning"
    whyItMatters: "Competition BBQ competes against heavily seasoned entries"
    examples:
      - bad: "Can only taste smoke and meat - no spice presence"
        good: "First bite has salt, then sweetness, then smoke, then heat"
        explanation: "Layers of flavor indicate attention to seasoning"

  sauceOverload:
    whatToCheck: "Excessive sauce that masks the meat"
    whyItMatters: "Judges want to taste your meat, not just your sauce"
    examples:
      - bad: "Thick layer of sauce where you can't see meat texture"
        good: "Thin glaze that adds shine and flavor while showing the meat"

categories:
  - id: "chicken"
    name: "Chicken"
    description: "Typically thighs, judged on skin rendering and moistness"
    indicators:
      - "Turn-in is chicken pieces"
      - "Often thighs, sometimes whole legs or breasts"
    considerations:
      - "Skin MUST be rendered - rubbery skin is automatic point deduction"
      - "Consider skinless or scored skin to help rendering"
      - "White meat dries out faster than dark"
    commonPatterns:
      - "High-heat finish for skin texture"
      - "Indirect cook then direct sear"

  - id: "ribs"
    name: "Pork Ribs"
    description: "Spare ribs or baby backs, judged on tenderness and bite"
    indicators:
      - "St. Louis cut spares or baby back ribs"
      - "Individual bones or sections"
    considerations:
      - "Spare ribs more forgiving than baby backs"
      - "The 'bend test' indicates readiness"
      - "Competition bite: clean teeth marks, not fall-off-bone"
    commonPatterns:
      - "3-2-1 method (spares) or 2-2-1 (baby backs) as starting point"
      - "Finish on grill for sauce set"

  - id: "pork"
    name: "Pulled Pork"
    description: "Pork shoulder/butt, judged on tenderness, moisture, and bark"
    indicators:
      - "Pulled/shredded pork presentation"
      - "May include bark pieces"
    considerations:
      - "Include bark pieces for texture"
      - "Money muscle (tube of meat) often presented separately"
      - "Don't over-process into paste"
    commonPatterns:
      - "Low and slow until 195-203°F internal"
      - "Rest before pulling"

  - id: "brisket"
    name: "Beef Brisket"
    description: "Whole packer brisket, judged on slice tenderness and smoke ring"
    indicators:
      - "Sliced brisket, usually from the flat"
      - "May include point (burnt ends)"
    considerations:
      - "Flat and point cook at different rates"
      - "Smoke ring shows proper low-and-slow technique"
      - "Slice against the grain"
    commonPatterns:
      - "Trim fat cap to 1/4 inch"
      - "Rest 1-4 hours before slicing"
      - "Present flat slices, burnt ends optional"

reviewGuidance:
  purpose: "Help cooks understand why entries scored the way they did."
  feedbackStructure:
    - "Score appearance, taste, and tenderness separately"
    - "Note what worked well before what needs improvement"
    - "Be specific: 'oversalted' not just 'seasoning issue'"
    - "Compare to competition standard, not backyard expectations"
  tone:
    - "Remember this cook invested hours and money into this entry"
    - "Frame feedback as 'next time, consider...' not 'you failed at...'"
    - "Acknowledge that competition BBQ is hard"
  reviewerMindset:
    - "You're comparing to the best entry you've ever had in this category"
    - "A 9 means 'excellent,' not 'nothing wrong'"
    - "Average competition scores are around 7, not 9"
    - "Judge this entry, not the cook's reputation"
